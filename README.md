## Status: Version 1 - Alpha Development

With the basic layout and design laid out, it's time to program the basic features and combine them with the design into a working program. Here are the list of basic features that's currently in development:

- [x] Add projects
- [x] Add tasks in respective project
- [x] Remove tasks from respective project
- [x] Storing project data
- [ ] Setting and storing card properties
  - [ ] priority
  - [ ] description
  - [ ] type
- [ ] Moving tasks from one panel to the next

Now, the overall aesthetics isn't going to be pretty but the app itself does work. You can go ahead and clone the project or visit the app [here](https://bug-tracker-delta.vercel.app/). The marked out features are ready to go.

>## <del>Research and Wireframing</del> **(DONE)**
